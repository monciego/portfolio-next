### Scholarship System for Pangasinan State University

I lead in the development of this **Scholarship Management System**, built as part of a master's thesis. The system streamlines the management of scholarships and provides students with personalized scholarship recommendations.

#### üîç Key features:

- **Scholarship Matching:** Uses the **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm** to suggest scholarships based on student profiles and eligibility.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Ensures accessibility on both web and mobile devices.
- **Efficient Data Management:** Built with **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, **Inertia.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with **MySQL** for data storage.

This project enhances scholarship accessibility and simplifies administrative processes through an intelligent and user-friendly system.
