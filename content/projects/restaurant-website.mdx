### Le Diable – Experience unique and tasty dish serve from underground

**Le Diable** is a **personal project** that holds a special place in my journey as a web developer. It was one of my earliest full-fledged websites, designed and developed entirely by me when I was learning **CSS, JavaScript, and responsiveness**.

This project pushed me to **practice UI/UX design, improve my CSS layout skills, and experiment with animations**. Every element, from the **web design to the logo and assets**, was crafted from scratch. Though it’s a **static website**, I envision rebuilding it dynamically with **modern technologies like Remix, Svelte, Solid, SST, Next.js, etc.** in the future.
