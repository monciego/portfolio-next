### Dasol Tourism System

I developed a **tourism management system** for the **Municipality of Dasol**, aimed at promoting local tourism and streamlining accommodation bookings for visitors. This system enhances both **business opportunities for property owners** and **travel experiences for tourists**, while ensuring **government oversight and regulation** of tourism-related activities.

#### üå¥ Key Features:

- **Property Registration & Approval:** Business owners can register their resorts, beaches, transient homes, and other accommodations. These listings undergo **government verification** before becoming available to the public.
- **Booking & Digital Ticketing System:** Tourists can browse, book accommodations, and receive a **unique digital ticket** that acts as proof of reservation.
- **Tourist & Visitor Tracking:** Property staff can track tourist activity, including **new bookings, check-ins, cancellations, and completed stays**, ensuring **accurate records of visitors**.
- **Government Oversight & Data Management:** Authorities can monitor registered property owners, track tourism trends, and **analyze visitor data** for policy-making and development planning.
- **Seamless Communication & Management:** Users can directly message property owners for inquiries, while owners can efficiently manage bookings and availability.

#### üèùÔ∏è Why It Matters:

This system **boosts tourism** by making it easier for travelers to find accommodations, book trips, and enjoy a seamless travel experience. At the same time, it **supports local businesses** by providing a **centralized platform for property listings and management**.

By leveraging **Laravel**, **MySQL**, **Alpine.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, the system ensures **performance, security, and scalability**, allowing the Municipality of Dasol to efficiently manage its tourism ecosystem.
