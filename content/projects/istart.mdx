## 🔍 The iSTARTMO Process

1. **See** – Utilize **human senses and tools** to observe an object in the immediate environment. In advanced topics like **Cell Biology**, this can include tools like microscopes.
2. **Think** – Mentally **outline** 3-4 ideas related to the object, considering aspects like **size, shape, color, location, imprints, and personal experiences**.
3. **Aim** – **Narrow down** to one of the outlined ideas and focus on it using **"Why" questions** to refine the research intent.
4. **Refine** – Identify an appropriate **verb** to specify **doable actions** related to the chosen focus. This is a crucial step, requiring **careful guidance** from mentors.
5. **Tell** – Use the **"verbed" focus** to outline the research methodology and communicate the approach to others.
6. **Mentoring & Outlining** – Receive **feedback** from a mentor and use it to structure the research steps **from start to finish**.
