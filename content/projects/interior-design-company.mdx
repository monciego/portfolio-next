### Elegance – Interior Design Firm Website

Built in **April 2021**, **Elegance** was one of my earliest projects when I was just beginning my deep dive into **web development**. It is a website for a **fictional interior design company**, designed and coded from scratch. At the time, I was exploring **animations, CSS layouts, and smooth user experiences**, making this project a pivotal learning experience.

#### 🎨 A Project That Shaped My Web Development Journey

This project was more than just a website—it was where I **learned animations, mastered CSS layouts, and experimented with JavaScript** for interactivity. The **smooth page transitions** and well-structured sections reflect my early passion for **creating engaging web experiences**.

Even though **Elegance** was built using only HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, it remains a **nostalgic milestone** in my journey, reminding me of how far I’ve come as a developer.
