### Mabini Government Website

I developed the official government website for **Mabini, Pangasinan**, focusing on user-friendly interfaces and robust functionalities to facilitate seamless public interaction.

The site provides essential information, public services, and municipal updates, ensuring accessibility for residents and visitors.

Built with **Laravel**, **Inertia.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vue.js**, it delivers a modern, responsive, and efficient experience.
