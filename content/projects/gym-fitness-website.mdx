### Fitness Gym Website – A Modern Approach to Health and Wellness

This is a **gym fitness website** I designed and developed using **ReactJS** and **Styled Components**, offering a modern, user-friendly landing page for a fictional fitness gym. The website aims to provide a seamless experience for prospective gym members, showcasing fitness programs, membership plans, and expert trainers.

Key features of the website include:

- A dynamic **Hero section** introducing the gym and setting the tone for the site
- A **Training Programs** section outlining the variety of fitness programs available, with fictional details about each one
- An **About section**, where I introduced our fictional **leading fitness experts**—the **founder** and **professional trainers**
- A **Benefits** section that explains the perks of joining the gym and signing up for our fitness programs
- A **Membership Plans** section, where users can choose from **Basic, Premier,** and **Elite** plans and toggle between **monthly** or **annual** billing options
- A **Testimonial section**, featuring fictional reviews from happy clients

This project achieved **10 stars on GitHub (as of writing)**. I designed the website layout in **Figma**, with a focus on clean design, responsiveness, and clarity. The design and functionality were intended to reflect the **dynamic energy of the fitness world**, ensuring a visually engaging and easy-to-navigate experience for potential members.
