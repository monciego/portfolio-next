**Role: Developer, Designer, Proponent**

A project that aims to digitize scholarship contracts and other important documents. It involves developing a computerized information system to facilitate digitized records' management, archiving, and retrieval.

Online scholarship system help to manage and organize the data of the scholars. Moreover, it provides fast processing of documents and generates list of qualified scholars. It also helps the Campus Student Services Coordinator with the processing of the list and reports. The system has features that can help automate manual process. Students can search for and view available scholarships that Pangasinan State University offers. They can apply for what scholarships are available. The system reminder will notify the user of the schedule and event. This system feature allows the admin to download the list of the scholars; the report is downloaded as an excel file.

We used the agile method in the development of the system. Agile Methodology is a practice that promotes continuous development throughout the system development process. The agile method is rapid because the user or the clients collaborate with the developer.

### **Tools for System Development**

• **Adobe XD** - I used adobe XD in designing and prototyping our system. Adobe XD is a vector-based digital design tool for websites, apps, and more.

• **XAMPP** - It's an open-source web-solutions kit that provides Apache delivery for various servers and command-line executables, as well as Apache API, MariaDB, PHP, and Perl modules.

• **phpMyAdmin** - I used phpMyAdmin to manage the database.

• **Laravel** - Laravel is an open-source PHP framework that is robust and easy to understand. It follows a model-view-controller design pattern. Laravel reuses the existing components of different frameworks, which help create a web application.

• **JavaScript** - I used some JavaScript for the frontend for the interactivity of interface.

• **Alpine.js** - Alpine is a rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in your markup. Think of it like jQuery for the modern web. Plop in a script tag and get going.

• **Tailwind CSS** - I used Tailwind CSS for styling. It is utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

### **Initial Prototype using Adobe XD**
