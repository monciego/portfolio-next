### A Minimalist Portfolio Built with AstroJS

This is my third **personal portfolio**, built using **AstroJS** for its fast performance and modern approach to web development. The design of this portfolio is intentionally **minimalist** and **simple**, reflecting my desire to focus on **clarity** rather than flashy design elements.

The portfolio includes:

- An **About** page where visitors can learn more about me and my background
- A **Work** section that showcases my projects and work experience
- A **Blog** section, including an article titled ["How I Built This Portfolio"](https://monciego.vercel.app/post/how-i-built-this-portfolio), where I dive into the technical choices and thought process behind creating this minimalist design

This portfolio marks a departure from the more complex designs of my earlier works, focusing on delivering content in the **most efficient** and **direct** way possible. After spending days iterating on design ideas, I realized that the portfolio’s goal was to introduce myself, showcase my skills, highlight my work, and provide an easy way for people to contact me.

The decision to embrace a **minimalist design** came from a desire for **perfection**—streamlining everything to be as clear and straightforward as possible, ensuring the focus stays on the **content** rather than the design itself.
