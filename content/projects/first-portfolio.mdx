### My First React Portfolio

This is a **personal portfolio** I built using **React (v17.0.2)** and **Styled Components** to showcase my early work as a developer. While it is no longer actively maintained, it served as a starting point to display my skills and projects during my early journey into web development.

Key features of the portfolio include:

- A dedicated **About Me** section, introducing myself and the technolgies I use as a developer
- A showcase of **previous projects**, giving insight into the technologies and techniques I was learning at the time
- A **Technologies Iâ€™m Familiar With** section to highlight the tools and frameworks I had experience with, including React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- A **Playground** section that includes various projects I created for **practice and leisure**, demonstrating my passion for learning and building new things

I designed this portfolio myself, reflecting my personal design style at the time, with an emphasis on clean layout and a user-friendly experience. This portfolio has received 30 stars on GitHub (as of writing).

While this portfolio is no longer updated, it stands as a testament to my growth and early exploration in web development.
